# The <span class="lab-name-accent">AI Ã— Cell Systems</span> Lab

Welcome to the **<span class="lab-name-accent">Atanackovic</span> Lab**! We are a research group focused on developing cutting-edge machine learning methods for understanding and modeling natural (physical) systems from data, with a particular emphasis on cellular and molecular biology.

Our research spans machine learning, generative modeling, causality, systems biology, single-cell biology, and protein & molecule design. We combine theoretical advances with practical applications to push the boundaries of what's possible in computational biology and AI.

**Interested in joining our lab?** Explore our [Research](/research/) areas and learn how to [Join Us](/join/) for opportunities at the intersection of machine learning and biology.

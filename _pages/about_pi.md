# About Lazar Atanackovic

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in [The Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

I am a member of the [Probabilistic and Statistical Inference Group](https://psi.toronto.edu/) supervised by [Brendan Frey](https://psi.toronto.edu/~frey/) and co-supervised by [Bo Wang](https://wanglab.ai/people.html). Previously, I was a research intern at [Recursion Pharmaceuticals](https://www.recursion.com/) / [Valence Labs](https://www.valencelabs.com/), [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/), and [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/).

My research focuses on developing machine learning methods for understanding and modelling natural (physical) systems from data, with a particular focus on cellular and molecular biology. My interests include generative modelling (flows and diffusion), deep learning, causality, single-cell biology, and recently, proteins & molecules.

## Research Interests

- **Generative AI**: Flow models, diffusion models, and generative flow networks
- **Systems Biology**: Single-cell analysis, gene regulatory networks, and cellular dynamics
- **Causal Discovery**: Understanding cause-and-effect relationships in biological systems
- **Deep Learning**: Neural network architectures for biological data
- **Protein & Molecular Modeling**: Computational approaches to understanding molecular structures and interactions

## Education & Experience

- **Ph.D. Candidate** in Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Toronto

The Atanackovic Lab focuses on developing cutting-edge machine learning methods for understanding and modeling natural (physical) systems from data. Our research spans multiple domains at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology.

# **Generative AI**

Our work in generative models focuses on developing novel approaches to model complex and high-dimensional dsitributions from data.

#### Key Areas:
- **Flow Models**: Flows for biological data generation
- **Diffusion Models**: Score-based generative models for molecular structures
- **Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)**: Learning to sample from complex discrete distributions


# **Systems Biology**

We develop computational methods that help us decode and understand complex biological systems at multiple scales, from molecular interactions to cellular dynamics.

#### Key Areas:
- **Single-Cell Analysis**: Computational methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data
- **Gene Regulatory Networks**: Inference and modeling of gene interaction networks
- **Cellular Dynamics**: Modeling temporal changes in cellular states
- **Perturbation Response Prediction and Modelling**: Understanding how interventions affect biological systems

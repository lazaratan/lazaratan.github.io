The Atanackovic Lab focuses on developing cutting-edge machine learning methods for understanding and modeling natural (physical) systems from data. Our research spans multiple domains at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology.

# <span class="lab-name-accent">Machine Learning</span>

Our work in generative models focuses on developing novel approaches to model complex and high-dimensional dsitributions from data.

#### Key Areas:
- **Generative Modeling**: Flow matching, diffusion models, generative flow networks (GFlowNets), and more
- **Representation Learning**: Learning to represent complex systems from data
- **Causal Inference**: Causal discovery and inference for (dynamical) systems


# <span class="lab-name-accent">Systems Biology</span>

We develop computational methods that help us decode and understand complex biological systems at multiple scales, from molecular interactions to cellular dynamics.

#### Key Areas:
- **Single-Cell**: Computational methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data
- **Gene Regulatory Networks**: Inference and modeling of gene interaction networks
- **Cellular Dynamics**: Modeling temporal changes in cellular states
- **Perturbation Response Prediction and Modeling**: Understanding how interventions affect biological systems
